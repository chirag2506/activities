    <h1>Constructor Functions</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Constructor functions are functions designed to construct a new object. Within a constructor function, the
            keyword this refers to a newly created object which values can be assigned to. Constructor functions
            "return" this new object automatically.</li>
        <li>Constructor functions are invoked using the new keyword.</li>
        <li>Constructor functions also have a prototype property which points to an object whose properties are
            automatically inherited by all objects created with that constructor.</li>
        <li>Objects created by constructor functions also have a special property on their prototype called constructor,
            which points to the function used to create them.</li>
        <li>Objects created by constructor functions are also considered to be "instances" of the constructor function
            by the instanceof operator.</li>
    </ul>
